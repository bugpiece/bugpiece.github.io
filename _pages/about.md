I am a master student at Kyushu University in Graduate school of Design in the [Laboratory of Ergonomics for All Ages and Abilities](https://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~muraki/en/index.html). My adviser is [Professor Satoshi Muraki](https://hyoka.ofc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/html/100021109_en.html).

My main research interests are in Human-Machine Motor Co-operation, Motor Control, and Techno-adaptability. The goal is to enable users to use assistive technologies like exoskeletons and power-assistive suits as if they were their own bodies.
